Solutions and Walkthrough for Openzeppelin's Ethernaut CTF written in Solidity with the help of Foundry.

Analysis and detailed solutions can be found on my blog - https://blog.dixitaditya.com/series/ethernaut

A guide on how to set up and get started with using Foundry and Solidity to write solutions for Ethernaut - https://blog.dixitaditya.com/getting-started-with-ethernaut-hello-ethernaut

* Codes for some levels are written completely in Solidity and are inside the `src` folder whereas 
* Others are written as foundry scripts which are also written in Solidity but they provide some extra cheat codes. These solutions are inside the `script` folder. 
* The `test` folder is just for experimenting. 
* The `instances` folder contains the original code for the levels which I'm using as interfaces. 

More levels will be added soon.
